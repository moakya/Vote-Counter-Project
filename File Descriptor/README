#Purpose:
 The purpose of the program is to calculate the total number of votes, 
 from the input directory, and opening every votes.txt file if present 
 and counting the votes. 
 The result is stored in other files, which are read by other 
 processes, until the final output file is created in the root 
 directory. 

#Compilation:
 To compile the program all that needs to be done is to have all the 
 *.c, the *.h files and the makefile in the same directory, 
 then in the terminal use the command
 "make", this will generate three executables, i.e. Leaf_Counter,
 Aggregate_Votes, and Vote_Counter 

#Execution:
 After compilation by utilizing the makefile, just type ./Vote_Counter 
 *, (where * would be the input path) in the terminal to run the program.
 This will generate multiple files, within multiple directories. 
 The final output file will be placed in the root directory and have a 
 .txt extension.
 If the command "make clean" is used in the terminal it will remove the executables.

#Process:
 The program uses parallelisation to execute multiple processes at once,
 this is done by going thorugh multiple directories and accumulating the results of
 votes.txt in other files that are convieniently placed in the subdirectories of the 
 same name. 
 To differentiate between leaf nodes and non leaf nodes, we check whether there 
 are other subdirectories within the directory or not, if not then we look for
 votes.txt, and if found run Leaf_Counter on it to generate the output file in the same
 directory.
 This process is repeated multiple times with the help of execs and forks that ensure
 that all the directories and subdirectories are visited and contain output. 
 Aggregate_Votes is in charge of adding all the votes in multiple output files and 
 saving its output in the correct directory.
 The main job of Vote_Counter is to call Aggregate_Votes, and then to check what
 candidate had the most votes, and add the name to the final output file.

 Error Checking has been implemented in the program and the codes are listed below:

    exit 01: Leaf counter executed on a non leaf node 
    exit 02: malloc failed
    exit 03: fork failed
    exit 04: exec fails
    exit 05: empty votes.txt file
